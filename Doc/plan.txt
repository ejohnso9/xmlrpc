Testing new GitHub tools, and trying to get up to speed with git...


I am new to iOS, as well as git, XMLRPC, and markdown. 

I didn't really find the sort of documentation I was hoping for with
this project, so as I go through the learning process, I hope to
contribute some of my discoveries; partially for my own reference, as
well as in the hope they will be useful to other beginner's in my own
boat.

The first will be a HelloWorld tutorial: a step-by-step intoduction to
getting XMLRPC installed, creating a simple client program in XCode for
iOS, and making that first call to the sample server and getting your
string echoed and returned.

Hopefully, eventually I will be able to make some meaningful and useful
contributions to the codebase as well.
