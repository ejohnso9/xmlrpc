Testing new GitHub tools, and trying to get up to speed with git...


I am new to iOS, as well as fairly new to XMLRPC.

My intention is to provide some useful documentation, as much for my own
benefit to refer back to as well as for other beginner's to get up and
productive using XMLRPC from an iOS environment.

Hopefully, eventually I will be able to make some meaningful and useful
contributions to Eric's codebase as well.
