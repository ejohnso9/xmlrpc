Another environment to try to get up to speed in.

I don't know markdown - seems like GitHub makes the conversion
automatically and displays markdown.

Home page for markdown language seems to be:

# Hello, XMLRPC!

A Beginner's step-by-step guide to getting up to speed using Eric
Czarny's XMLRPC for MacOS/iOS. I didn't really find the sort of
documentation with this project I had hoped for, so I will try to
provide it...

I think XMLRPC is actually a lot easier to use than you might think by
opening the Tools/Sample Client project, so I will attempt to walk you
through the first steps of getting things actually going.


## Git the source distribution

Probably the best way to do this is to simply clone the GitHub
repository using 'git'. You'll need a git client for this, which can be
found at the [GIT's download page](http://git-scm.com/download) 

To run this from a Unix-like environment, you could execute the
following command:

    git clone git://github.com/eczarny/xmlrpc.git

This should create the 'xmlrpc/' directory. Assuming you already have
Apple's XCode IDE installed, we have evertying we need to get going.
(If not, you can probably handle things from here:
[iOS Dev Center](http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action)

everything else we need to get going

(NOTE: these list elements get ordered automatically)

1. Git the distribution


1. Create a new XCode project
